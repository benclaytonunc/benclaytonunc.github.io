This website is all about Space and Fun!

I used 4 apis to pull the ISS location, google maps, jokes, and trivia questions.

Meteor Shower is a fun game to thrust your way out of trouble and to shoot everything in sight. My high score is 2800!

Want to know where the fastest moving 6 people are? Well check out my International Space Station Tracker and you well see up to date tracking of the 25,000km/hr+ moving station.

To have a quick laugh go look at some corny jokes!

Lastly, if you want to play some trivia don't hesitate. We have plenty of categories to choose from.
Hope you enjoy!
